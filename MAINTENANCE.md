## Review and Merge Policy

In case there are multiple maintainers, non-trivial changes should be reviewed
by another team member. A review is requested through the GitHub UI.

If a change is not reviewed within 1-2 weeks, the merge request may be merged
without a review.

For urgent bugfixes, the review may be skipped.

## Non-Responsive Maintainers

time period, other members of the SpaceAPI community can and should take over
the maintenance of the project.
